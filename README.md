## My News - Frontend

### Link to API: https://newsapi.org/

### Link to deployed app: https://nick-my-news-frontend.herokuapp.com/

#### Note on API_KEY
Need to change API_KEY variable configuration in backend config file if trying to run locally. Current state of API_KEY variable checks for a config variable with heroku, therefore the deployed site is functioning correctly.
